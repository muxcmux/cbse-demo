## CBSE module demo

This is a 'couple-of-hours' demo I did for a presentation at SEC faculty at Kingston University (2012) on RESTful interfaces and API providers/consumers

# Run it

* Clone repo and `cd` in dir
* Create a db called cbse_dev
* Edit credentials in `config/database.yml`
* Install dependencies `bundle install`
* Run `rake db:migrate`
* Boot up rails server with `rails s`
